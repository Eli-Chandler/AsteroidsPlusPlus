To do: Make asteroids into sprites for optimization



Game:

You control a spaceship with the mouse and click

You have a landing base that you have to land at to get upgrades

You fly through a field of asteroids and collect coins which get you upgrades

You have limited fuel and if you crash you lose all your coins

Upgrades:

Dampers - hold right click to slow down the rocket ship

Sponsorship - Get near misses with asteroids to get coins

Speed adjuster - Use the scroll wheel to change thrust force

Blaster - Used to shoot asteroids

Tracter beam - used to collect coins

Fuel upgrade - More fuel

Asteroid miner - green asteroids can be used to mine fuel from


Make it so the timer is your 'oxygen' you can use your coins to buy more upgrades at the base such as more oxygen, and your oxygen is restored when going back to base, instead
of instantly dying on contact with an asteroid you could lose all of your fuel which would cost you time to back to base. There could be satellites farther out that you could buy
the location of and they would provide better upgrades, end game could be getting to the moon or mars.
